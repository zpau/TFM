In this section, we have focused on learning the basics of the “cartopy” python library so we can plot different maps from our study zone. The main objective was to create some useful functions that allow us to plot simple maps from our study zone. We created two functions. The first one (mapa) plots a map from our study zone and the different CTD stations. The second one (map_layers) was created to help with the analysis of the layers’ classification and plots a map of the study zone where the different CTD stations are coloured according to their number of layers. Both functions are stored in the python file “maps.py”.
