In this section we present 3 notebooks with two functions associated 

"Distances.ipynb" shows a script to compute the distances between stations

"transsect_distances.py" is the function that sums up the distances computing


"Bathymetry.ipynb" shows a script to compute the bathymetry between stations

"bathymetry_transsects.py" is the function that sums up the bathymetry computing


"Vertical_Sections.ipynb" shows a script to create vertical sections of different transects using the bathymetry and distances previously computed


"transsects_dataconc.py" is a function that creates a concatenate matrix of all the stations of a transect.
