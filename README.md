Repository of my Master Thesis Project
In this repository I will post all the steps of my Master Thesis Project

This is an oceanography project where I will analyse CTD data.

The CTD data includes measures of different variables (salinity, temperature, depth, density...) from the whole seawater column and from different points of the space (stations)
